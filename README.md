# FEX-Task

Make doing a bunch of simple tasks look professional.
Task progress display will adapt to the width of the command window, and will adjust the color depending on successful/unsuccessful task exit status.

Tasks can be grouped in sub-tasks, sub-sub-tasks etc. Such task groups can be configured to be atomic (either ALL pass, or the whole group fails), or non-atomic (task execution will continue even if some have failed).

Run `Task_DEMO.m` for a brief demonstration.

The documentation is still very sparse; I'm just publishing to get it out there.
